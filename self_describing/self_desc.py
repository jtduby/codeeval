"""
    Self Describing Numbers Solution: v0.3

    Taken from: www.codeeval.com/open_challenges/40/

    Description:

        A number is a self-describing number when (assuming digit positions 
        are labeled 0 to N-1), the digit in each position is equal to the 
        number of times that that digit appears in the number.

    Input sample:

        The first argument is the pathname to a file which contains test data,
        one test case per line. Each line contains a positive integer. Each 
        line is in the format: N i.e. a positive integer. e.g.

            2020
            22
            1210

    Output sample:

        If the number is a self-describing number, print out a 1. If not, 
        print out a 0. e.g.

            1
            0
            1


    Version History:
        0.2: Worked on documentation.
        0.3: Major code refactoring and documentation rewrites.
