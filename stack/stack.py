    Stack Implementation Solution: v0.2
      
    The specs say we'll be handling integers. There's no need to make this
    stack implementation that narrow. Making it more generic and robust. It
    will handle any object.

    Version History:
        v0.1: Works according to spec.
        v0.2: CodeEval passes a blank line in input. They imply that there
              will be no blanks and do not state how to handle them. Fixed.
