"""
    Hex to Decimal Solution: v0.4

    Yes, I know that Python will convert between hex and dec. But using that
    ability kind of takes the fun out of the challenge, doesn't it?


    Version History:
        0.2: CodeEval breaks spec and passes upper case characters. 
        0.3/0.4: Cleaning code, refactoring, fixing documentation.
