"""
    Sum of Primes Solution: v0.4
   
    Finds the sum of primes between 2 and 1000. The result is printed to 
    stdout.

    Version History:
        0.1: Brute force.
        0.2: Implemented memoization and use of computed primes for testing
             the current number.
        0.3: Modularization of code. 
        0.4: Fixed documentation
