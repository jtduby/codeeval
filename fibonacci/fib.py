"""
    Fibonacci Solution: v0.6

    Takes, as an argument, the path to a file with a positive integer n on
    each line. Prints the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence to stdout. 
    
    Version History:
        0.2: Couldn't bring myself to calculate the fib each time. Created an
             object to memoize already calculated values.
        0.3:  --Refactored and cleaned up code.
              --Changed memoization storage from list to dict for lower-cost
                lookups.
        0.4/0.5:  More code cleaning and some documentation fixing.
        0.6: Added to Fib documentation.
